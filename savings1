You have a business of many bicycles that
 people can rent. We assume that:
 24 hours within the same day.
The rate per hour depends on the time 
of the day as follows: 0 - 7         and 21-24  the rate 
is RWF 500 per hour 7-  10     and      19-21 the rate
 is  RWF 1000 per hour 10- 19 the rate is 1500 per hour 
 Write a python program that takes as 
input the starting time and the ending time 
and  does the following:
(a) If the starting is greater than the
 ending time or the sarting time or ending
  time is out of the range 0-24, 
  then display invalid input
(b) Print the total amount to be paid 
by the renter.def calculate_rental_amount(start_time, end_time):
    Check for invalid input: time out of range or start time greater than end time
def calculate_rental_amount(start_time, end_time):
    Check for invalid input: time out of range or start time greater than end time
    if start_time < 0 or start_time > 24 or end_time < 0 or end_time > 24 or start_time > end_time:
        return "Invalid input: Start and end times must be between 0 and 24, and start time must be less than or equal to end time."
    solution:
    total_amount = 0

    # Rates according to the given time periods
    def get_rate(hour):
        if 0 <= hour < 7 or 21 <= hour <= 24:
            return 500
        elif 7 <= hour < 10 or 19 <= hour < 21:
            return 1000
        elif 10 <= hour < 19:
            return 1500

    # Calculate the total amount based on each hour
    for hour in range(int(start_time), int(end_time)):
        total_amount += get_rate(hour)

    return f"Total amount to be paid: {total_amount} RWF"

# Input from the user
start_time = float(input("Enter the start time (0-24): "))
end_time = float(input("Enter the end time (0-24): "))

# Calculate and display the total amount
print(calculate_rental_amount(start_time, end_time))
